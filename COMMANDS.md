# FulpTronJS
A stinky DiscordJS bot

If you want to suggest stuff for the bot, drop them in this chat: https://discord.gg/GBJwxs

## List of commands!!!
The prefix is `fulp` so an example command would be `fulpPlaying` with no spaces like that. Also the commands are not case sensitive, so you could do something like `FUlpPiNG` if you're some weirdo

parameters will be indicated in <> these brackets when required. If there's multiple they should be seperated by a single space (NOTE: the brackets do not need to be included in the message! Those are just to show when to seperate parameters)

- `fulpHelp` will drop a link to this page!
- `fulpPing` pings the host and returns the time in milliseconds
- `fulpShame` just shouts SHAAAME
- `fulpServer` sends some info about the server, like amount of memebers
- `fulpUptime` sends uptime in seconds lol
- `fulpAddRole <role>` gives you a certain role. The role parameter is case sensitive! example: `fulpAddRole Artist` would give you the artist role
- `fulpRemoveRole <role>` removes one of your roles. Again the role parameter is case sensitive
- `fulpASL <age> <sex> <location>` fulp is a fukken creep
- `fulpPlaying <anything lol>` sets FulpTron's discord playing status to whatever you input
- `fulpWatching <also anything lol>` sets FulpTron's watching status to what you input
- `fulpSay <anything>` make fulptron say funny things ahah epic
- `fulpRoll <min number> <max number>` pretty much the same shit as every other bot with a dice command lol. If you dont input any number it rolls a D20
- `fulpPic` gets a random Tom Fulp pic from my collection
- `fulpDogl` gets a random [Dogl](https://doggenhausen.newgrounds.com) pic from my collection (using `fulpPic dogl` also works)
- 'fulpQuiz' Asks a multiple choice question (shoutout to BrenBot for the inspiration lololol)
- `fulpSHOOM` **SHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM**
- `fulpNGFollow <newgrounds user>` gives a shoutout to whatever Newgrounds user you input!
- `fulpNGScrape <Newgrounds user>` sends you some info about whatever Newgrounds user you input, into a nifty little Rich Embed.
- `fulpSource` drops a link to the sourcecode on Github
- `fulpEval` command to execute any piece of javascript, on the official FulpTron, only I can use it heheheh

### VARIOUS MUSIC COMMANDS!!
I got a bunch of music code from this bot lol I pretty much stole all that shit so go check it out: https://github.com/Dev-Yukine/Music-Bot/

Also you need to be in a voice channel to use these

- `fulpPlay <youtube link/playlist or search terms>` The bot allows you to search for music through discord! Or you can drop a link to an individual song or playlist
- `fulpSkip` Skips the current song and goes to the next one in the queue
- `fulpStop` Stops all the music and empties the queue
- `fulpVolume <volume from 0-100>` Changes the volume for all users. 100 usually sounds yucky and distorted if you have the defauilt discord user audio set at 100% as well. Usually 25-50 sounds alright
- `fulpnp` aka `fulpNowPlaying` as the command suggests, it shows what song is currently playing.
- `fulpQueue` Displays the list of songs to be played, or as some schmoes call it, a *queue*
- `fulpPause` Pauses the current song
- `fulpResume` If paused, resumes the music
