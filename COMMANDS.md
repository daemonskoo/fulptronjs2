# FulpTronJS
A stinky DiscordJS bot

If you want to suggest stuff for the bot, drop them in this chat: https://discord.gg/GBJwxs

## List of commands!!!
The prefix is `fulp` so an example command would be `fulpPlaying` with no spaces like that. Also the commands are not case sensitive, so you could do something like `FUlpPiNG` if you're some weirdo

parameters will be indicated in <> these brackets when required. If there's multiple they should be seperated by a single space (NOTE: the brackets do not need to be included in the message! Those are just to show when to seperate parameters)

- `fulpHelp` will drop a link to this page!
- `fulpPing` pings the host and returns the time in milliseconds
- `fulpShame` just shouts SHAAAME
- `fulpServer` sends some info about the server, like amount of memebers
- `fulpUptime` sends uptime in seconds lol
- `fulpAddRole <role>` gives you a certain role. The role parameter is case sensitive!
- `fulpRemoveRole <role>` removes one of your roles. Again the role parameter is case sensitive
- `fulpASL <age> <sex> <location>` fulp is a fukken creep
- `fulpPlaying <anything lol>` sets FulpTron's discord playing status to whatever you input
- `fulpWatching <also anything lol>` sets FulpTron's watching status to what you input
- `fulpSay <anyhting>` make fulptron say funny things ahah epci
- `fulpRoll <min number> <max number>` pretty much the same shit as every other bot with a dice command lol. If you dont input any number it rolls a D20
- `fulpNGFollow <newgrounds user>` gives a shoutout to whatever Newgrounds user you input!
- `fulpSource` drops a link to the sourcecode on Github
- `fulpEval` literally a command that lets you hack into my PC, no jokes. However only I can use it heheheh
